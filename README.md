Game description:<br>
  Before playing the game you need to make an account.<br>
  Once you have an account you can log in and play the game.<br>
  Note that the navigation menu is pulled out using the tab button on the left side of the screen.<br>
  You have the option of changing the key that you use to shoot before starting the game.<br>
  Every time you start a round you must choose a ship type, with each type having a bonus:<br>
      - Shooting faster<br>
      - Moving faster<br>
      - Having an extra life<br>
  Use the keys to move your ship and the shooting key to shoot (spacebar by default).<br>
  If you get hit you lose a life, and the game is over once you have no lives left.<br>
  If you kill all enemies or the time runs out you will be scored according to which enemies you killed.<br>
  Your score will be added to a high-score screen.<br>
We hope you enjoy the game!<br>
