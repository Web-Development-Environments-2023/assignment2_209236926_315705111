Game description:
  Before playing the game you need to make an account.
  Once you have an account you can log in and play the game.
  You have the option of changing the key that you use to shoot before starting the game.
  Every time you start a round you must choose a ship type, with each type having a bonus:
    Shooting faster
    Moving faster
    Having an extra life
  Use the keys to move your ship and the shooting key to shoot (spacebar by default).
  If you get hit you lose a life, and the game is over once you have no lives left.
  If you kill all enemies or the time runs out you will be scored according to which enemies you killed.
  Your score will be added to a high-score screen.
We hope you enjoy the game!
